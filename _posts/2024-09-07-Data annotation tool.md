I recently developed a data annotation tool for multiple categories, inspired by the work of [Khalil Acheche](https://github.com/khalilacheche/CS552_annotator).

You can upload your data with categories as columns, label them and download the labelled data fromt the web. You can also upload a partially labelled data and pick up from where you left off. Check this tool here: [Link](https://cocohhhhh.github.io/data_labeller/)
