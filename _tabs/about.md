Hi there! I’m Ke, a master’s student at EPFL with a passion for exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, natural language processing (NLP), and data science. My journey in AI has been driven by curiosity and a love for solving complex problems through innovative technologies.

Nice to meet you here!
